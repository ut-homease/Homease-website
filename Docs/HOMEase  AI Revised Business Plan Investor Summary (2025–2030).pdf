HOMEase | AI Revised Business Plan Investor
Summary (2025–2030)
Executive Summary
1. Executive Summary
HOMEase|AI is a high-conviction, AR-driven lead generation platform connecting
homeowners in need of aging-in-place (AIP) modifications with qualified local contractors.
Originally envisioned as a full-service provider managing the entire home modification
journey—including assessments, project management, and outcomes tracking—we
strategically pivoted to a pure-play lead generation model. This decision was grounded in
speed-to-market, capital efficiency, and early monetization.
Building a vertically integrated solution would have required years of clinical outcome
validation, complex insurance and hospital sales cycles, and significant upfront
investment in service infrastructure. Instead, we leverage our AR-powered scan-to-lead
technology to deliver high-intent, pre-qualified homeowners directly to contractors. This
approach generates revenue immediately while allowing us to gather data as a Trojan horse
for future partnerships with payers and providers.
Our platform makes HOMEase|AI the easiest way for contractors to access aging-related
home modification leads—and the easiest way for families to take action. Our streamlined
business model accelerates market penetration and unlocks national scalability.
