            <p>
              HOMEase was created out of frustration â€” and a vision for something better. Too often, we've seen loved ones discharged from hospitals into homes that aren't safe or supportive.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe everyone deserves to live safely and independently in their own home. Our mission is to bridge the gap between healthcare and home modification.
